We create our own luck
======================

## Definition of Problem
Deconstructing the concept of purpose to an accessible and palatable level, so that users (and potential users) of the Clarity program know more clearly what they will get out of the program or where they are headed with it.  


## Draft

Purpose can be a loaded word.  We can think that we're supposed to "follow our bliss". 

There is no grand plan in life. Personally, I have discovered that purpose makes the most sense to me as a fairly pedestrian concept.  Purpose to me, simply means a reason or a motivation behind an action.  I don't think we can find one purpose for our entire lives.

I think the searching for one purpose in our lives is folly.  Searching for purpose in the form of one single entity is surely going to result in disappointment or disillusionment.  Our lives are more intricate and rich than can be boiled down into a single concept.  A concept, even if in abstract form, is still a thing.

When we connect two things together.  The space between any two points is filled by a narrative we craft.  We can either craft this narrative in a positive and empowering light or in a debilitating or disempowering light.

Any action can be taken in life and hold no meaning.  Conversely, an action taken with an intention suddenly is imbued with a sense of meaning, i.e. "this action is being done for this reason".

Then when the intention behind such an action is aligned with our highest values or a vector (meaning movement in a certain direction) towards our goals, the meaning generated becomes significant. 

It is this process of connecting our highest values or goals to our intentions with an action that we generate a sense of purpose in our lives. 

> Purpose Process

	Intention ---> Action ---> Goals/Values

Seen this way, finding one's purpose is less a process of "catching a shooting star" and more reorienting to a star in the sky.  Rather than something we "catch", it is more something we simply define.  

There is direction and alignment in this process.  Things must align in a single direction.  But that is it.
