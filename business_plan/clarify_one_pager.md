Clarify _(working title)_
=========================


## Value Proposition
Helping people who are feeling stuck make a difference in their lives and others by generating a personally meaningful next-step forward.

## Market Need
While so many facets of life generally are better than ever before (greater wealth, less poverty, less war and famine) people by and large are unhappier, more listless, and feeling more unfulfilled than ever before.

While there is a greater choice and opportunity than ever before and more ways to connect with people than ever before, people are suffering broadly from a deficit of meaning in their lives.

## The Solution
While so many of us are desperately searching for some sense of meaning in our lives, Clarify works with the notion that we are truly not that far from it.  Though it is often seen as a rare concept one must have especially good fortune to catch, we believe  that it is more like something hidden right under our noses.  

Clarify works with the notion that meaning is simply what comes from connecting two points, and the two points it focuses on are *where you are* and *what direction you're going*.  Seen from this perspective, meaning may be somewhat pedestrian but in turn it hopefully is far more accessible.

To take a step of any significance from where you are to the direction your'e going requires a vision of where you're going, a sense of where you came from, and the tools to build the momentum.

Clarify is a short 10 day program with thematically linked concepts and resonating exercises that help people establish where they've been, formulate where they're headed, and 
## Competition
Many tools look to "transform" people, changing them in some fundamental way away from who they are.  But we can never escape ourselves, and so Clarify takes a different approach.  Working with the notion that we are nearly always not far off from where we want to be (which is simply on "track" to where we'd like to go), Clarify utilizes the quite basic but incredibly powerful process of "meaning generation" or connecting intention to vision through action.

## Key Concepts

### Meaning
We're all searching for it, truly.

### Momentum
Bit by little bit.

While it may not exactly feel like it, you've already been building up a lot of momentum.  And it's quite a lot easier to shift course a little bit than have to bring down all your momentum to stop and then completely change direction.

### Dharma - the way - the journey over the destination

### Reorientation
You are a lot closer than you probably think.  You're most likely not miles off course from where you'd like to be.  To be clear, whatever vague vision you have in mind of where you'd like to get to is not our goal.  We're not going to use that target as a barometer of success whether or not we reach it.  We're simply going to use it as a target to point our energies forward towards.
