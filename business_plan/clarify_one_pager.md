Clarify _(working title)_
=========================
 
 
## Value Proposition
Helping those feeling stuck or unfulfilled create a personally significant next step; a step that brings with it a life of greater meaning; a life where waking up in the morning brings excitement about what can be created that day. 

## Market Need
Today there is less widespread poverty, famine, crime, and war than ever before. People have more possibility to do a variety of things with their lives than they ever have before.  And yet, people by and large are more miserable than they've ever been.  

(statistics on people's general state of misery and feelings of being unfulfilled)

Why is this happening?   

 - the offerings of a capitalist economy
 - the ever disintegrating value in previous social bonds 
 - the nearly unlimited possibility of what people can do with their lives
	- growing up they always hear it
	- and now more than ever they have the mobility and opportunity


 
Even though in many things are better than they ever have been before and people are better off, it may be precisely because of this where one's basic necessities are provided for that one is naturally left to search for something more.  One is naturally left to ask: what have I done? What have I brought to this world? What value do I truly have? I am anything more than a simple cog in a machine? And does my life hold any true value? 

While, a multibillion dollar advertising industry works very hard to fill this sense of longing by selling us this or that new widget, the attainment of these things always bring a fleeting sense of joy and is never fulfilling. To put it another way, we are suffering broadly from a deficit of meaning. 

Growing up people are frequently taught that they could be "anything they want to be".  But bereft of a true sense of what they truly want to be, people are left satisfying their desires through the attainment of objects, which always brings a very fleeting sense of fulfillment.  Some look elsewhere but cannot find anything and feel as if they have been cheated; as if they bought this idea of a life when they were younger that was never true. 

They are seeking a sense of fulfillment through product or transformations, from getting something new or being someone else.

A sense fulfillment which can only be created through intentional creation of one's life. 

## The Solution
Clarify is a 10 day program; each day with a corresponding module containing powerful concepts and exercises, all completed in roughly 30 minutes a day.

There is no one key thing out there that will provide the solution to this problem.  The attainment of any one thing always prompts the looking for something new.  What's needed is a process that can be replicable.

A reset. 

Most products out there seeking to address improving people's lives tend to focus on "transformation".  This implies that people are "broken" in the state they're in and need to transform into something else.  While the narrative of transformation is very compelling, we can never escape who we are and all we have experienced.  It is in this attempt at escape from one's old self, whereby one inevitably finds remnants of their old self returning, and is left to consider themselves a failure once again - they have not completely transformed.  The stuff that bothered them before is still happening. 

Clarify is different in that it is a short, focused, and accessible program that teaches a process.  Once done, it can be replicated throughout one's life.  It also works off the concept that it is who we are right now which makes us unique and that uniqueness which makes us powerful.  Finally it is built off the notion that we are never far off from being in line with our true self.  Most often what we need is a reset and reorientation and then a directed and intentional step forward.  Followed by another and another and so on.  

For, a sense of fulfillment only can only come from taking creative action in small steps towards a higher goal.  It is the active construction of one's own life which brings a greater sense of meaning and fulfillment to one's life. 

## Competition
Many tools look to "transform" people, changing them in some fundamental way away from who they are.  But we can never escape ourselves, and so Clarify takes a different approach.  Working with the notion that we are nearly always not far off from where we want to be (which is simply on "track" to where we'd like to go), Clarify utilizes the quite basic but incredibly powerful process of "meaning generation" or connecting intention to vision through action. 

## Key Concepts

### Meaning
We're all searching for it, truly.  

### Momentum 
Bit by little bit.

While it may not exactly feel like it, you've already been building up a lot of momentum.  And it's quite a lot easier to shift course a little bit than have to bring down all your momentum to stop and then completely change direction.

### Dharma - the way - the journey over the destination

### Reorientation 
You are a lot closer than you probably think.  You're most likely not miles off course from where you'd like to be.  To be clear, whatever vague vision you have in mind of where you'd like to get to is not our goal.  We're not going to use that target as a barometer of success whether or not we reach it.  We're simply going to use it as a target to point our energies forward towards.
