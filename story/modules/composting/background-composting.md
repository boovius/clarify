## Composting (going back/repurposing)

By owning the power of our set of life experiences - everything we have done, learned, failed, accomplished, and experienced - we carry forth with us a tool that no one else can wield.  We can yield this tool with a sense of possibility to create new life and new experiences.  This new life and new experience, our true expression of ourselves and creativity, is our greatest gift to the universe.

If you're not giving this, you're giving something that someone else has already given and probably given better than you are currently.  Every stumble you have had, every little seemingly meaningless thing you have learned, every errant life choice or venture you have made - these all allow us to give something no one else can.
