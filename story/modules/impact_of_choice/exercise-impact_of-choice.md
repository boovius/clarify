####Exercise: _recognizing your faculty_

 - Look over your life map
 - Start at 1 year ago
 - Roll your die
 - Go that many increments back
 - Look over the event that you land on

What happened to you during this time?  Imagine taking another course of action than the one you took during that time.  There must be something, some way things would have been quite different if you had made a different choice than the one you did.

Now let's go deeper.

Using your die pick another event at random.  Look hard at this event.  **Ask yourself, what did I do, what choices did I make leading up to this event that helped to create it?**

Own this. Take responsiblity.  We are not just victims of our circumstances.
