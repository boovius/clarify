#### Exercise: _Destroy your goals!!_
 - Take the stack of the big post-it notes.
 - Write down on each one a goal from your past, something that you had wanted to achieve in your past
 - Write down all the people whom you wanted to be at various points in your life
 - If you're having trouble focusing, think in roughly five year increments of your life starting with your later teenage years. What  had you most wanted to accomplish for your life when you were a teenager, in your early twenties, late twenties, early thirties, late thirties, etc.
 - 	Put them into a bowl and light them on fire (if this seems extreme or unsafe, rip each one up until they're basically illegible), then get rid of the waste.  Get it out of your home.
 -  Then when you toss them in the garbage (outside of your home), and verbally (out loud) wish them all well.  Your goals have served you well in the past.  So thank them.  But they are now no longer with you.  They now no longer chain you. You are reborn.
