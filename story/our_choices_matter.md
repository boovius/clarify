## Our choices do matter
When we look over the course of our life's events, it's easy to see how much happens to us.  Looking at things that way it can feel like much is out of our control.  And that sucks.

No matter what happens in our lives we always retain a power to choose how to respond to the events that occur and the things that happen to us.

Our choices we make are the single most determining factor in how we experience life.  The way we respond to things in life means far more to us than the things we are responding to.   

We certainly cannot control or make all the things that happen in our lives around us.  But the choices we make (consciously or subconsciously) do create the situations we experience or end up in.

Our choices are one ingredient in the mixture of stew that is going on all around us.  They are not the entire stew.  But they are one powerful ingredient.  Now changing one ingredient, even a powerful one, cannot turn a stew into an apple pie.  But changing one powerful ingredient ineffabily turns what would have been one type of stew into something else.  

Now describing your choices as one ingredient is probably less accurate than simply saying your choices are analgous to you being the chef.  Or in maybe more like a wizard-chef in a cooking competition.  With your powers you can create some ingredients but you are given a set of others you must work with.  

So yes, you are constrained by what you are given.  But you have choice.  And cooking your ingredients one way produces something.  While cooking them some other way produces something else.  

An even better analogy might be a surfer.  A surfer relies on their skills but is also entirely depenedent upon the waves.  If no waves, a surfer will not surf.  A surfer's experience can at its best be the best of what they can do on the wave they are given.  A surfer does not create the wave but two surfer's experience on the same wave may be entirely different.  The choices a surfer makes of timing, when to paddle, when to pop up, how to position their body weight all dramatically affect the experience they have.  They do not create the wave.  But they do create the experience.  

This is true of us in life as well.

Own this.  Do not run from it.  Take responsiblity for creating this situation.  There is tremendous power in recognizing this.  Your choices do affect the way your life is.  They have.  So that means they absolutely can in the future.  


####Exercise: _recognizing your faculty_

 - Look over your life map
 - Start at 1 year ago
 - Roll your die
 - Go that many increments back
 - Look over the event that you land on

What happened to you during this time?  Imagine taking another course of action than the one you took during that time.  There must be something, some way things would have been quite different if you had made a different choice than the one you did.

Now let's go deeper.

Using your die pick another event at random.  Look hard at this event.  **Ask yourself, what did I do, what choices did I make leading up to this event that helped to create it?**

Own this. Take responsiblity.  We are not just victims of our circumstances.
