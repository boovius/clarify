#### puzzle pieces:
We know deep down that the truth is we cannot where our stories are going to go. We cannot predict the future and life (or shit) always "happens".  The universe is much bigger than us individuals and we know, even though we do not act always as such, that we cannot control everything.
 
We try and try and try.  And because we've created the narrative, the space we're trying to fit our puzzle piece into is certainly close.  But that just makes it that much worse. 
in response to this terror of not-knowing (of nothingness, of unsolidity), 


#### self actualization vs belonging
It is a very natural tendancy to aspire to models we see of others' lives.  We grow up admiring professional atheletes and movie stars and world leaders.  Some of us grow up admiring our parents and/or siblings. 

As we grow older, we tend to aspire less and comform more.  Belonging is an important need we all have as human beings.  The fear of not-belonging can be very powerful.  

While this need for belonging and the need for self-actualization are not in conflict by nature, they tend inspire us which take actions which favor one over the other.  

No one can know where their lives are headed exactly.  But we all have desires for self-actualization and fears of non-belonging.
