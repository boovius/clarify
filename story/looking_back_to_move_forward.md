LOOKING BACK TO MOVE FORWARD
============================

It is only by looking back that we are able to discern the path from which we came, and then only from there, are we able to take a new step forward with the sense that this step is aligned with our true nature.

Our stories have power.  And this power can either be empowering or limiting.  Attempting to take on a story for our future is extremely limiting.  Owning the stories of our past is incredibly empowering.  


## Owning the power of our past story
### We actually all are snowflakes
Well, not literally.  

But like snowflakes each of us is completely and entirely unique.  Our genetic code by itself almost certainly makes us unique.  If then by chance, we share a genetic code with an identical twin, our set of life experiences, which shapes us, sculpts us, and molds us, further distinguishes us uniquely from anyone else. Then on top of all that, if you believe like I do that each of us carry a unique spirit, we are distinguished that much further.

This means that there is something we have that no one else does.  And it is from this, unique to us and uniquely our own, which no one else in the universe also has, that we are able to give our greatest gift to the universe.

### Owning it so we can give it
By owning the power of our set of life experiences - everything we have done, learned, failed, accomplished, and experienced - we carry forth with us a tool that no one else can wield.  We can yield this tool with a sense of possibility to create new life and new experiences.  This new life and new experience, our true expression of ourselves and creativity, is our greatest gift to the universe.  

If you're not giving this, you're giving something that someone else has already given and probably given better than you are currently.  Every stumble you have had, every little seemingly meaningless thing you have learned, every errant life choice or venture you have made - these all allow us to give something no one else can. 

#### Exercise A - Repurpose: _Composting_

All events in our life sculpt us, no matter what they are: good, bad, big, small.  They all make a difference.  They all evolve us further, make us more of who we are.

Consider the most frustrating or difficult moment you experience in the last 6 months (or 12 months if nothing pops to mind for the last 6).  This shouldn't be a traumatic event you're still in the middle of.  For instance, probably do not choose the death of a loved one, try choosing something else; a moment where you were intensely frustrated or bored or felt like a failure or maybe a bit ashamed or embarrassed.

Consider, what ways was this experience truly hard for you?  In one word, how would you describe this experience?  Shitty?  Painful?  Frustrating?  Terrible?

We tend to framing events or experiences that happen to us in our minds with a single brush stroke.

But this is rarely our true "take-away" from such an experience. 



Now turn this event on its head.  Imagine that it all happened perfectly as you wanted it to.  Imagine that you wanted exactly what this experience brought to you because you wanted to grow from it.  


#### Exercise B - Meaning: _Connecting your dots going backward_

We cannot build a map of our life going forward into the future.  But we basically can do this going backward.  So let's go backward.

 - take the large poster board
 - take the stack of small post-it notes
 - write down a significant event from your life from 3 months ago.  Then write one for each 3 month increment going back to five years ago.  Do 6 month increments for the prior 5 years. 1 per year for the 5 years before that.  Then fill in where you feel appropriate before that and in between.  (_You of course have some flexibility here.  If you have really significant events occuring inbetween your 3 month increments or none for 6 months that is okay.  But try hard, push yourself to come up with these._)


**Use 1 color for events of:**

 - pride or accomplishment
 - deep pain, shame, or depression
 - powerful moments of clarity/focus/direction in which you began to move your life in a new direction
 - adventure
 - setbacks or moments of failure  

Meaning in our lives does not come by accident.  We create it.  And we do so by making connections.  One event by itself is insignificant.  But connect it to something else then suddenly there is meaning.  This lead to that.  

**Now connect your dots.**   

Take your 20 sided die.  Roll it.  Whatever number you get is how many events you will go back on your map.  Place marker A down on your map.  

Now roll it again.  Place marker B down on the map.

What connects these two events?
 
If you were to begin writing a book about a character and knew nothing else except that they experienced these two events, where would they go in your story?
  

## Adopting stories of our future which limit us 
When we adopt stories of our future, we are attempting to set a course or path for where our life is going to go.  But this is impossible.
 
We cannot know where our lives will go.  But go they will.  And this uncertainty of "not-knowing" where our lives are headed, how they're going to "turn out", is terrifying.  Not knowing is a naturally scary condition.

So we "adopt" narratives of how our lives are going to be; narratives that sound good to us based upon the models we have seen from our idols or family or friends. But this is at its essence, an effort to try to make known the unknown.  

Deep down, we all know this to be true: our path going forward is created, moment by moment. In adopting narratives, we try to set a course for our lives that almost assuredly does not align to the path our true nature creates, moment by moment.  This creates a conflict.  And our reaction to this conflict tends to be to try to force our path to match the one of our adopted narrative.  This is very limiting and can be extremely debilitating. 

It is like desperately trying over and over again to force a puzzle piece into an opening that looks like it should fit but just does not.

#### Exercise: _Destroy your goals!!_
 - Take the stack of the big post-it notes.    
 - Write down on each one a goal from your past, something that you had wanted to achieve in your past
 - Write down all the people whom you wanted to be at various points in your life
 - If you're having trouble focusing, think in roughly five year increments of your life starting with your later teenage years. What  had you most wanted to accomplish for your life when you were a teenager, in your early twenties, late twenties, early thirties, late thirties, etc. 
 - 	Put them into a bowl and light them on fire (if this seems extreme or unsafe, rip each one up until they're basically illegible), then get rid of the waste.  Get it out of your home.
 -  Then when you toss them in the garbage (outside of your home), and verbally (out loud) wish them all well.  Your goals have served you well in the past.  So thank them.  But they are now no longer with you.  They now no longer chain you. You are reborn.



## What's next
While we cannot build a map for ourselves going forward, what we can build for ourselves going forward is a compass....
