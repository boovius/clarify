LOOKING BACK TO MOVE FORWARD
============================

It is only by looking back that we are able to discern the path from which we came, and then only from there, are we able to take a new step forward with the sense that this step is aligned with our true nature.

Our stories have power.  And this power can either be empowering or limiting.  Attempting to take on a story for our future is extremely limiting.  Owning the stories of our past can be incredibly empowering.

### We actually all are snowflakes
Well, not literally.

But like snowflakes each of us is completely and entirely unique.  Our genetic code by itself almost certainly makes us unique.  If then by chance, we share a genetic code with an identical twin, our set of life experiences, which shapes us, sculpts us, and molds us, further distinguishes us uniquely from anyone else. Then on top of all that, if you believe like I do that each of us carry a unique spirit, we are distinguished that much further.

This means that there is something we have that no one else does.  And it is from this, unique to us and uniquely our own, which no one else in the universe also has, that we are able to give our greatest gift to the universe.
