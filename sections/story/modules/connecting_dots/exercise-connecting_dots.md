#### Exercise B - Meaning: _Connecting your dots going backward_

We cannot build a map of our life going forward into the future.  But we basically can do this going backward.  So let's go backward.

 - take the large poster board
 - take the stack of small post-it notes
 - write down a significant event from your life from 3 months ago.  Then write one for each 3 month increment going back to five years ago.  Do 6 month increments for the prior 5 years. 1 per year for the 5 years before that.  Then fill in where you feel appropriate before that and in between.  (_You of course have some flexibility here.  If you have really significant events occuring inbetween your 3 month increments or none for 6 months that is okay.  But try hard, push yourself to come up with these._)


**Use 1 color for events of:**

 - pride or accomplishment
 - deep pain, shame, or depression
 - powerful moments of clarity/focus/direction in which you began to move your life in a new direction
 - adventure
 - setbacks or moments of failure

Meaning in our lives does not come by accident.  We create it.  And we do so by making connections.  One event by itself is insignificant.  But connect it to something else then suddenly there is meaning.  This lead to that.

**Now connect your dots.**

Take your 20 sided die.  Roll it.  Whatever number you get is how many events you will go back on your map.  Place marker A down on your map.

Now roll it again.  Place marker B down on the map.

What connects these two events?

If you were to begin writing a book about a character and knew nothing else except that they experienced these two events, where would they go in your story?
