Iteration - Purpose Cycles - Building Momentum
==============================================

## Definition of Problem
Distilling down the concept of "purpose cycles":

 - the process of setting one's course
 - taking an action to produce momentum in that direction
 - then reflection on the action taken and the new location one find's oneself in

This process then starts over with the re-setting of one's course. This re-setting can stay as it was or course-corrections can be made.
