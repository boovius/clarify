## Connecting the dots going backward
In order to take a step forward, one must know where one is.  

Imagine knowing that you want to move in the direction facing Northward.  You konw this in your bones.  But you're not facing North.  You're facing East.  And so, even though you have a sense of where you're going and that you want to go North, when you take a step forward, you're not going in the direction you want.  The only possible way to move forward in a direction you want is to first be oriented in that direction.

To orient ourselves, requires a surveying of where we are.  But where we are is meaningless by itself.  It only matters as a point in relation to where we have come from.

We may feel a pull towards a certain direction at times in life but find ourselves unable to gain a sense of moving towards whatever it is that is pulling us. To move forward with any significance requires two things: to have a sense of where we want to go and to be pointed in that direction.  After that, all that's left is the going.  And that just takes a bit of effort. 

Trying to move your life forward without a sense of where you have come from is like stepping blind.  You know you're taking a step from where you are.  But you have no clue if you're going in the right direction.

Instead of turning around in circles, blown this way and that way by the ocean currents, we are going to reorient ourselves.

From that place of reorientation, will can then discern which way is forward.

But in order to reorient we must look back upon the path we came.  We must have a sense of where we came from in order to know where we are.  And it is only in knowing where we are that we are able to know where we want to go next.

### Everthing we do and experience further distinguishes us
Every little thing you've done has made you a little bit more you, has given you some more experience and grown you a little bit further away from who you were in the woom. Each hard and tough experience has shown you something, taught you something, sculpted you a bit more, and made you a bit more distinguished, a bit more unique.

### We actually all are snowflakes
Well, we are not literally snowflakes.

But like snowflakes each of us is completely and entirely unique.  Our genetic code alone almost certainly makes us unique.  If then by chance, we share a genetic code with an identical twin, our set of life experiences, which shapes us, sculpts us, and molds us, further distinguishes us uniquely from anyone else. Then if you believe that each of us carry a unique spirit or essence wihtin us, then we are distinguished that much further.

### This is our gift to give
This means that there is something we have that no one else does.  And it is from this, unique to us and uniquely our own, which no one else in the universe also has, that we are able to give our greatest gift to the universe.
