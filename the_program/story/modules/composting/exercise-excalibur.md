#### Exercise - Flipping the Script: _Redefining_

Look back upon the map of your story in front of you.  

Now consider a narrative that you have been carrying about yourself or your life that you are not proud of, that you're embarassed of or maybe even ashamed of. 

What do you think people think about you, what's wrong with you, why you're not succeeding? 

Look at your map and consider how the dots line up with that very-limiting narrative.

Consider how long you have a carried this story about yourself.  Now ask yourself real earnestly, has looking at yourself and your life in this way been helpful to you or not helpful?  Has it brought you a sense of possiblity in life or weakend your sense of what is possible for you and felt limiting? 

This is a choice, how we interpret our lives and the stories around them.

The thing is though, no matter how ugly or heavy or debilitating this story has been for you over many years, the elements that make it up are still you.  And they are only you.  No one else.  No one else shares this story.  And all these elements have given you a certain set of learnings and perspective and growth that no one else has.

Consider all the elements that make up this debilitating story.  Now consider them a tool.  One you can wield to interact with others and the world.  No one else in the whole planet can wield this tool.  

It is your own personal Excalibur.
