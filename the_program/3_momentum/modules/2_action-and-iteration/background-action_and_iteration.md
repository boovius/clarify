## Action

We create change with one thing - Action.  It is the one ingredient without which there are no others.

There are many things that may go into taking Action.  But Action is the only fundamental constant that brings forth meaningful change.

Change will happen with or without your input.  But it is through your input that meaningful change will occur.  Bringing about meaningful change in your life, deepens your own sense of meaning in your own life.

While you can survive without deeper meaning in your life, it's like having watched HDTV and then going back to a standard-def television set with a real knowing sense that there is something way better out there.  Your life of deeper meaning is your HD life.
