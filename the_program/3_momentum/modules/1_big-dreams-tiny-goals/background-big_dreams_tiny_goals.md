Big Dreams/Tiny Goals
=======================

This is really where our work in the last several modules is going to begin paying off.  Now we begin to move.  And movement, especially movement that is directed, intentional and connected to a place of deep meaning in us, is exhilirating.

We're going to start slow, since you cannot go from 0 to 100 in one step.  But we musn't attempt to move too fast.  The trick is to reach ahead just outside of our comfort zone.  We must stretch.  But stretch too far and we'll break.

This is not a race but a long, long marathon.  As Tony Robbins says (paraphrasing), "people often tend to overestimate what they can accomplish in one year and underestimate what they can accomplish in 10".  A child does not immediately become an adult in one step.  What we are trying to do is learn how to purposefully (but ecstatically) marathon.

We're going to be progressing in small increments.  Each step we take will move us forward, building on top of the last and building our momentum.  But each step must be measured so we that we can turn any step we take into one that is unconscious.  

The strategy here is to habitialize our forward movement, step by step.  Only once one level of action is habitialzed does it become effortless.  And only when the last step becomes effortless can we take that energy and focus it towards our next step.  

All in all though our focus is going to be on **focus**, not on what we want to *get out* of any particular step, but what we want to *put in* to it.  The end is less important than the beginning here.

Each step is like one paddle with an oar in the water.  Each time we paddle and pick up our oar of the water we can decide which direction we want to paddle in next.     


## Exercise - Setting Intention and Focus

Take the vision that emerged out of the last module, our Ikiagi-Lighthouse, and write (or draw if you prefer) on the right side of a piece of paper.  On the left side draw a stick figure.  Put a "this is me" above the stick figure.  
Now begin filling up the space in between you and your Ikigai-Lighthouse with visions of what you are doing before you reach your Ikigai-Lighthouse. 

Set a timer for 10 minutes.  Push yourself to be creative and come up with ideas during this interval.  But take as much time as you need, if ideas are continually flowing.

#### Lining up the dependencies

Now take index cards and write down one for each step you've drawn out in between where you are and your Ikigai-Lighthouse. 

Now arrange them in groups.  Which items go together?

Now form these groups up into lines, putting those items that are pre-requisites for the rest at the top?  Which things must come before the others?

----

#### Prioritize

Now look over the lined up groups that you have.  Which one is really *the* most important, the most important to attack first?  What needs to come before the other others?
