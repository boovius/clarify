Big Dreams/Tiny Goals
=======================

Throughout this program we have been trying to work with goals in different ways than we tend to in our life.

In day 3 we destroyed all our goals.

We've made a lot of progress at this point.  We have our compass, our lighthouse, our beem pointing us forward.  We know where we've come from and we've reoriented ourselves with our path and repurposed our life's experience.  
This has all brought us to here, now, where we have sense of where we are and where we are headed.  So now we will begin the work to take a tiny but powerfully meaningful step forward.

This is not a race but a long, long marathon.  As Tony Robbins says (paraphrasing), "people often tend to overestimate what they can accomplish in one year and underestimate what they can accomplish in 10".

Our aim here is to establish a pattern of taking meaningful and signficant small steps.  Each step is a transition from one place to another.  Another way to look at it is that each step is in itself a transformation from one state to another.

A child does not immediately become an adult in one step.  What we are trying to do is learn how to purposefully (but ecstatically) marathon.

Goal setting can be an enormously powerful and vital tool for plotting our course and giving ourself the mechanism for feedback.

We're going to uitilize tiny goals.  Not small.  Tiny.  We're going to think about what we want our first step to be.  And then draw it back to a more easily achievable state.  And then we're going to do that again.  Our first steps out of the gate here will seem laughlable small. They should be "too" easy.  That's okay.

We're going to build a pattern of little wins here.
