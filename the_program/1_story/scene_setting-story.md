LOOKING BACK TO MOVE FORWARD
============================

It is only by looking back that we are able to discern the path from which we came, and then only from there, are we able to take a new step forward with the sense that this step is aligned with our true nature.

Our stories have power.  And this power can either be empowering or limiting.  Attempting to take on a story for our future is extremely limiting.  Owning the stories of our past can be incredibly empowering.
