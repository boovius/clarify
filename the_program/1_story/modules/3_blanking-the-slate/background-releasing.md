## Adopting stories of our future which limit us
When we adopt stories of our future, we are attempting to set a course or path for where our life is going to go.  But this is impossible.

We cannot know where our lives will go.  But go they will.  And this uncertainty of "not-knowing" where our lives are headed, how they're going to "turn out", is terrifying.  Not knowing is a naturally scary condition.

So we "adopt" narratives of how our lives are going to be; narratives that sound good to us based upon the models we have seen from our idols or family or friends. But this is at its essence, an effort to try to make known the unknown.

Deep down, we all know this to be true: our path going forward is created, moment by moment. In adopting narratives, we try to set a course for our lives that almost assuredly does not align to the path our true nature creates, moment by moment.  This creates a conflict.  And our reaction to this conflict tends to be to try to force our path to match the one of our adopted narrative.  This is very limiting and can be extremely debilitating.

It is like desperately trying over and over again to force a puzzle piece into an opening that looks like it should fit but just does not.
