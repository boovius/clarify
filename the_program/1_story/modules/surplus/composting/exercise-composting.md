#### Exercise - Repurpose: _Composting_

All events in our life sculpt us, no matter what they are: good, bad, big, small.  They all make a difference.  They all evolve us further, make us more of who we are.

Consider the most frustrating or difficult moment you experience in the last 6 months (or 12 months if nothing pops to mind for the last 6).  This shouldn't be a traumatic event you're still in the middle of.  For instance, probably do not choose the death of a loved one, try choosing something else; a moment where you were intensely frustrated or bored or felt like a failure or maybe a bit ashamed or embarrassed.

Consider, what ways was this experience truly hard for you?  In one word, how would you describe this experience?  Shitty?  Painful?  Frustrating?  Terrible?

We tend to framing events or experiences that happen to us in our minds with a single brush stroke.

But this is rarely our true "take-away" from such an experience.



Now turn this event on its head.  Imagine that it all happened perfectly as you wanted it to.  Imagine that you wanted exactly what this experience brought to you because you wanted to grow from it.
