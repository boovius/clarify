## Ikigai Connections

The island of Okinawa in Japan is considered one of the world's 5 "blue zones", an area where people tend to live far longer than average.  The village of Ogimi in Okinawa has the highest life expetancy in the world.  Many attribute the longevity to the concept of Ikigai, a word that doesn't directly translate into English but has been described as "the art of always being busy" or a "meaningful life through activity".

We're not striving for a long life (though that is likely preferred) here, so much as one of more deep meaning and purpose right now.  But there are very valuable lessons to be gleaned from this idea.

For one, there is the beautiful simplicity of the ven diagram which often is attributed to going along with ikigai. 

It is activity which we love, we're good at, has potential for financial value, and is something the world is in need of.

### Exercise 1 - drawing out your Ikigai

We're going to start with a brainstorm exercise focused first on the things you are good at.  Let's open this up to all things and possibilites.  Do not sell yourself short.  You're certainly good at many, many things.  If you've failed at something over and over again, you're likely really good at some part of it or you're "good at" the knowledge of it. 

Write these down in little thought bubbles at the top, center position of your paper.  Take **10 minutes** to do this.

Now, draw an area to the left side and label it "what you love".  Draw a line under this title.  Then make connections between the things your good at and what you love.  Draw lines connecting those things that you have written to be good at as also being those you love or bring you joy.

Now do this similar to the right side and label this one "what the world needs".  Draw a line under that header and do the same thing on this side you did before, draw connections between those things you are good at to this section here of what the world needs.

Finally create a section in the middle but away from the top, closer to the bottom (though still with enough space to write in).  This is the final section of "what has potential for financial value (i.e. what you can get paid for)".  Same thing.  Draw connections between what you are good at and this section here.

----

First review what you have drawn.  Are there any other connections you could make that you were shy to at first.

Now consider what items traversed the most areas.  The ones that hit 3 to 4 areas, these are your core, list these select ones on a new page. 

(*caveat: if one of the areas you are missing with a core is that it brings you joy, DO NOT continue with it*)  

Let's mash these ideas together.  What can you be in combination of these core attributes?  What can you create in combining them into some magical new concoction?
