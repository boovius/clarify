## Lensing

We're going to take our visions, our ikigai, and our core values from the beginning of this experience and mash them together.

We're going to draw the ven-diagram of ikigai, with its four overlapping sections.  In the very middle, we're going to write the ikigai concoction we made in the last exercise.

We're then going to fill around that all our visions from the other day. We'll write each one onto an individual post-it and then place each in the ikigai ven-diagram where they belong.  

Ask yourself, does this vision represent something I love, something I'm good at, somewhere in between? For each vision and section.

Similar to the map of your past you now have a map of you.  Except we're going to take this a step further and distill out a single point from this map.

You only get 1.  Sorry.

Consider your values from the very beginning.  What here matches the values of a life you aspire to live, how you aspire to live?

What is the one thing we can take from this, the one thing we can point ourselves in going forward, the one thing that compells, excites us, lights us up more than any other?
