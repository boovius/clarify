## Lensing

We're going to take our visions, our ikigai, and our core values from the beginning of this experience and mash them together.

We're going to draw the ven-diagram of ikigai, with its four overlapping sections.  In the very middle, we're going to write the ikigai concoction we made in the last exercise.

We're then going to fill around that all our visions from the other day. We'll write each one onto an individual post-it and then place each in the ikigai ven-diagram where they belong.  

Ask yourself, does this vision represent something I love, something I'm good at, somewhere in between? For each vision and section.

Be precise with where each vision goes but also allow yourself to be open with the placement.  If a vision could cover multiple areas or land smack in the middle of your ikigai, then place it there.  We're trying to make connections here, not be overly particular. Ask yourself, "can this vision apply to this area, this area, this area...?" etc.

----

After placing all your visions upon your ikigai board, what do you see?  What visions landed in the middle?  What visions come from this place in the center?  This center is our compass line.

Similar to the map of your past you now have a map of you and your dreams.

Remove the rest of the visions you placed around your ikigai, those not in the center, off to the side.

Alternative Route - if you do not have ANY visions that made it to the center of your ikigai-board then we'll work in alternative manner.  Look for instructions down below.

Now we're going to distill this down further, and then we're going to bring it to life.

First we'll start with a honing exercise to bring further definition. We're going to look at the visions that have made it to the center of our ikigai-board and pass them through the lens of our core values (our highest or deepest values) that we defined at the very beginning of this program.

Ask yourself - What visions here align with my core values?  Be true with yourself and hard on these visions.  If it is in alignment, keep it.  If it is not, place it off to the side.   

*Lifestyle - tales from Karen Moore and Joe Giammalvo*

Consider what here matches the values of a life you aspire to live, how you aspire to live?  

Consider what is the lifestyle you want or dream of having? - what visions match up or not to with this?  

Consider how you want to be feeling each and every day of your life?  Peaceful? Calm? Rested? Joyful? - what visions can match up with this? 

Place all those visions that do not match up with your dream lifestyle, how you'd love to be feeling each day, and your core values off to the side.

Priorities *Anecdote of Warren Buffet and his pilot - the "avoid at all costs list"*

Now we're going to take all the visions that do not remain and put them away in an envelope.  You can revisit these at certain moments you're desiring some inspiration or a breath of nostalgia.  But a purposeful life must be a focused one - even if that purpose is to live a life just you personally dream of. 

----

Finally - now that we're left with our most defined ikigai/vision-board, we're going to literally draw a picture of what this is.  This will be our guiding light.  Our lighthouse.  Our compass.  This will guide our way and keep our way.

This is the one true point that compells, excites us, pulls us, and lights us up more than any other?

You may hate to draw or think you suck at it.  That is ok.  This drawing, this ultimate vision is for you and really no one else.  You may show it to people if you like. But it is truly just for you.  You don't have to hang it up in your house for others to see (though I think this is a powerful practice).  You can keep it next to your bed at night in a draw or envelope and pull it out before you go to sleep and after you wake up and take a look at it.  

There will be days where you will feel frustrated that you're not making as much progress towards this vision as you would like.  That is ok.  Understand it is not a goal but a direction.  The point is NOT to attain it but to move (and keep moving) in its direction.

----

**Alternative route:** if none of your visions can be applied to the center of your ikigai board then let's do another quick vision exercise, taking our ikigai from the previous exercise and go forward.

We're going to do a vision exercise similarly to the module a couple days ago.  But we're going to start with our ikigai and then work outwards.  

You have your ikigai.  Now imagine someone gifts you $5 million but the caveat is that you have to put it towards your ikigai.  What do you do?  What do you create?
