## Opening up to possiblity

### Limiting ourselves based on what others think is "right" or "sane" or "safe"
Too often we limit ourselves to what is possible in our lives based on all the things we've heard.  "You can't do this, that's crazy!".

People have a tendancy to poo-poo new ideas from others as any new idea (no matter how unrelated to them truly) poses some amount of threat to their perception of social order.  "If you can do things this way, does that mean that my way is wrong?"  Then before giving themselves the time to truly answer that, people frequently jump to the conclusion that the new way of doing things you present to them must be wrong so as not even to entertain the threat to their preconceived notions. 

It's scary to be ourselves, especially in the face of doubt or criticism. And most often this doubt and criticism we feel from others comes from within us.  We stop ourselves from fully expressing ourselves for fear of this reaction from others. We tend to equate the approval of others very highly. But even more insidiously we fear their disapproval.  Getting kicked out of the tribe, getting excommunicated, is a super deep fear we all have.  But this leads us inevitably to conformity, which sucks away our personal creativity and expression.

But remember, your life isn't made to be like anyone else's.  It can't be.  There's only one you and so it must be different.  So we can either live our true selves to our fullest capability and shine as brightly as we can or we can adopt the pathways of others and shine a bit more dimly. 

### Fear based mentality  
Another thing that limits us a consequence-first fear-based mentality.  This is really normal, and people tend to take this approach first and sometimes always.  Now, to a large degree this is smart e.g. don't tell your boss that they're an asshole because they didn't acknowledge your good efforts even though you want to and don't tell that guy on the subway that he's an asshole for bumping into you even though you want to.  We can envision future realities and this helps us out.  

But too often our looking forward focuses in on calamity.  We tend to be so afraid of calamity that we do not take any action that may lead to it. Though any action can, and calamity will occur even when no action has been taken by you.  There's no way to avoid it.  

But I'm very confident that you've been running up into calamity your entire life.  And that each time you've braved it, gotten through it, and then actually grew from it.  

We run from perceived calamity even though we've seen ourselves time and time again get through these moments.  People are *incredibly* adaptable.

By focusing in on fear, we come up with all the reasons that we "cannot" do this or that thing that is pulling at us.  But this more than anything is stifling your truest expression of yourself and is in a very real way suffocating you spiritually. 

Remember you're either giving your fullest gift into the universe or you're not.
