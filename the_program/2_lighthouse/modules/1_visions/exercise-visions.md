#### Exercise - mind-map lightning round

We're going to do some thought exercises, working on off some hypothetical constructs.  We're going to be working quickly.  The point here is to become unobstructed and let creativity flow, not inhibit ourselves in anyway and generate a lot of ideas.  This will be a rapid fire instense brainstorm activity.  We're going to be going through a variety of scenarios all in 3 minutes each, using a separate sheet of paper for each scenario.

Essentially we will be creating mind maps.  However, though this is a brainstorming activity and therefore one of mind, it is of vital importance that the energy for these ideas flows from your heart.  They must come from a deep and honest place inside of you.  So though this may sound cheesy, for each scenario we're going to begin by drawing a heart in the center of the page.  As the ideas come to us we'll write them down in the space around the heart and then draw a line from our heart in the middle to whatever vision we come up with.

**Scenario - nothing to lose 12 months - 3 minutes**
You feel like you are in perfect health but after a routine examination by a doctor gives you a prognosis of only having 12 months to live.  You’re freaked and seek a second opinion.  Same result.  You’re in shock.

You have 12 months to live.  What do you do?  What do you do with your life?  Who do you go see?  Do you travel?  Where do you go?  What experiences do you seek out? 

**Scenario - nothing to lose 5 years - 3 minutes**
Same as the above but now the timeline is different.  You have a certain amount of time to live but now it is 5 years.  Maybe enough time to really build something.  What do you do?  Who do you go see?  Where do you go?  What do you try to build? 

**Scenario - you can do no wrong - 3 minutes**
A universal basic income is passed. And medical scientists in your home country working on a cure for cancer that goes awry.  Chemicals get released out into the wild and spread to everyone in the world. But they're happy pills. Suddenly no one really cares about money.

What do you do? 

**Scenario - everyone you know is gone - 3 minutes**
Medical scientists working in your home country on a exploratory treatment for cancer wind up creating a freakish out-of-control disease that spreads like wildfire.  It afflicts a tremendous number of people across the globe but it strikes primarily in the area it came from, your home country.  Scientists rapidly work to find a cure before the entire world is engulfed in it and they do. The world is able to return mostly to a sense of normalcy where things resemble pretty closely to what they do now.  Except for one key thing.  You have survived.  You are fine.  But pretty much everyone you know and love and care about was afflicted and is suddenly gone.  Your family, your close friends, those who have been mentors or parental figures in your life growing up -- they’re all gone.

You’re in good health.  And now so is the rest of the world.  You’re free to keep living your life as you do now, basically.  Except no one has any expectations for you.  No one has anything at stake in what you do or how your life turns out.  It could turn out in absolutely any fashion imaginable and it would not matter one bit to a single person you can think of right now. 

What do you do?
