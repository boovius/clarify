## Exercise - mind-map lightning round

We're going to do some thought exercises, working on off some hypothetical constructs.  We're going to be working quickly.  The point here is to become unobstructed and let creativity flow, not inhibit ourselves in anyway and generate a lot of ideas.  This will be a rapid fire instense brainstorm activity.  We're going to be going through a variety of scenarios all in 5 minutes or less, and for each, we'll be using a separate sheet of paper.

Essentially we will be creating mind maps.  However, though this is a brainstorming activity and therefore one of mind, it is of vital importance that the energy for these ideas flows from your heart.  They must come from a deep and honest place inside of you.  So though this may sound cheesy, for each scenario we're going to begin by drawing a heart in the center of the page.  As the ideas come to us we'll write them down in the space around the heart and then draw a line from our heart in the middle to whatever vision we come up with. 

For each vision that comes to you during this exercise, write it in the first person, present-progressive form from what you are doing.  So "I am doing ..." or "I am living ...".

### Belonging

**Scenario - nothing to lose 12 months - 3 minutes**
You feel like you are in perfect health but after a routine examination by a doctor gives you a prognosis of only having 12 months to live.  You’re freaked and seek a second opinion.  Same result.  You’re in shock.

You have 12 months to live.  What do you do?  What do you do with your life?  Who do you go see?  Do you travel?  Where do you go?  What experiences do you seek out? 

**Scenario - nothing to lose 5 years - 3 minutes**
Same as the above but now the timeline is different.  You have a certain amount of time to live but now it is 5 years.  Maybe enough time to really build something.  What do you do?  Who do you go see?  Where do you go?  What do you try to build? 

**Scenario - everyone you know is gone - 3 minutes**
Medical scientists working in your home country on a exploratory treatment for cancer wind up creating a freakish out-of-control disease that spreads like wildfire.  It afflicts a tremendous number of people across the globe but it strikes primarily in the area it came from, your home country.  Scientists rapidly work to find a cure before the entire world is engulfed in it and they do. The world is able to return mostly to a sense of normalcy where things resemble pretty closely to what they do now.  Except for one key thing.  You have survived.  You are fine.  But pretty much everyone you know and love and care about was afflicted and is suddenly gone.  Your family, your close friends, those who have been mentors or parental figures in your life growing up -- they’re all gone.

You’re in good health.  And now so is the rest of the world.  You’re free to keep living your life as you do now, basically.  Except no one has any expectations for you.  No one has anything at stake in what you do or how your life turns out.  It could turn out in absolutely any fashion imaginable and it would not matter one bit to a single person you can think of right now. 

What do you do? 

**Scenario - you can do no wrong - 3 minutes**
A universal basic income is passed. And medical scientists in your home country working on a cure for cancer that goes awry release a virus out into the wild that spreads to everyone in the world. But this is unlike the exercise above where everyone you know and care about dies.  Here everyone, everyone you know and don't know, just become happy and in touch with themselves. Suddenly no one really cares about money.  People seem to be expressing themselves, creating things, and embarking on endevours that appear to come from the deepest parts of their souls. 

What do you do? 

### Possibility

**Scenario - sudden heir to a fortune - 5 minutes**
You get a call from a mysterious man, a lawyer, whom you've never met or heard of before.  The lawyer tells you that his client, who's wish it was to remain anoymous, was an incredibly wealthy tech titan, and that his client has bequeathed to you $5 million.  It's yours, he tells you.  It's yours to spend.  Your heart begins to flutter.  Adrenaline begins pumping through your veins.  You're insanely excited but also terribly confused.  "Why me?", you ask.  The lawyer tells you that his client had their eye on many, many people in their life from afar and they took a special liking to you.  Something about your unique story and life appealed to them.  

You take a moment to catch your breath.  "What now?", you ask.  The lawyer begins to explain how the money will be transferred to you but before he does, he mentions that there are stipulations in the will. 

The first stipulation is that you must spend it the money. You cannot save it.  The second stipulation is that you must spend it on doing something, not things.  You cannot buy material goods with it.  But you can buy a trip around the world.  You cannot buy a house or a car.  But you can use it to finance a certain way of life or education.

What do you do?  What do you spend it on? 

**Scenario - A second chance and anything you want - 5 minutes**
You're in a plane flying from Europe to Morocco.  Suddenly the plane hits a terrible patch of turbulance.  The plane begins losing altitude horribly quick.  You feel the air pressure changing too fast.  People all around you are screaming shrieks of death.  The oxygen masks drop down.  You put yours on.  Look at your neighbor next to you.  You black out.

You come to.  You're on land.  On sand.  It's night time and the wind is whipping around you but you barely notice the chill on your skin.  As your disorientation slowly fades, you begin noticing burning pieces of wreckage scattered around you, and you realize that you've just been in a plane crash.

You begin running from piece to piece of the wreckage scattered about looking for any other survivors.  It becomes apparent to you after a while that there is no one else there alive.  You begin to panick.

Nearly an hour later after you've calmed down some, you begin to feel the deep cold of the desert at night.  It seems to you that you'll likely freeze unless you find some shelter.  Off in the distance you can see some mountainous terrain so you begin to wander off in that direction.

You don't know how many hours later you arrive at the mountains.  There's plenty of places to find shelter from the wind.  You wander into cave, scared, nearly blind in the darkness, and terrorfied.  

You wander deeper into the cave and suddenly stumble and trip over something.  Your mind tells you it's a rock but as you get a closer look afterwards it becomes clear to you that it is man made.  It's a chest.  You open it.  Inside is some kind of metal object.  You take it in your hands.  There's an inscription on it.  You rub your hands over it.  BANG!!!

A flash of light blinds you momentarily.  "You have awakened me," says a deep voice. That's right. You just discovered a real life genie.  The genie tells you that it is his duty to grant you wishes.  But the wishes are life based, meaning they must come from your deepest desires and that you must express a vision of a life you wish to be living, then he will grant you the pieces around such a life.

What type of life do you want to be living?  You get to create absolutely anything.  What do you want to be doing?  Who are you surrounded by?
